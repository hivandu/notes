# Android 3.0

<p>好吧,7.1号Eldar Murtazin在其博客上已经放出一个可信度比较高的谣言,就是Android3.0将于十月份发布,代号姜饼(Gingerbread)

据传,3.0rom将会针对高端市场,分辨率达到了1280X760,支持此系统的最低配置将为1Ghz处理器,512M内存.可以这么说,在3.0系统发布以后,就可以正式宣布G1被彻底淘汰了.
<ul>
	<li>Android 3.0 Gingerbread will be released in mid- October (around 15 -16th), 2010. First handsets shipping in November/December – for the Holiday Season.</li>
	<li><em>Minimum</em> hardware requirements for Android 3.0 devices are: 1GHZ CPU, 512MB or RAM, displays from 3.5” and higher.  (We all, of course, heard that <a href="http://www.unwiredview.com/2010/06/10/motorola-raises-the-bar-with-plans-for-2-ghz-android-in-2010/">Android handsets with 2GHz CPU’s</a> are coming)</li>
	<li>New 1280×760 resolution available for the devices with displays of 4” and higher. (Anyone thinking about Android tablets now? )</li>
	<li>Completely revamped user interface. If you want to get a feeling of what Android 3.0 Gingerbread UX is like, check out the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E1mSSBKEPU" target="_blank">Gallery  App</a> on Nexus One. The same overall feel, light animated transitions,etc. Natively, through all the UI.</li>
	<li>Android’s split into 2 branches becomes official. 3.0 for top of the line/high end devices. Cheap, low-end mass market handsets will keep Android 2.1/2.2</li>
</ul>
